# 🗄️ SQL Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **SQL Projects Portfolio** 👋  
This repository contains my SQL-based data analysis projects, where I use **PostgreSQL** to clean, transform, and analyze real-world datasets to answer meaningful business questions.

Each project focuses on **practical SQL usage**, including data exploration, aggregation, filtering, NULL handling, and deriving insights from messy data.
